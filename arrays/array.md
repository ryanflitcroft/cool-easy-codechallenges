## Array Function TDD way

[Link to different Array Methods](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_methods.asp)

## Instructions

* note some of these methods used to achieve the test return the length ot the array I want you to return the updated array. Also some take one parameter and the others take two parameters in the functions.

1. Write a function that adds a new entry to the array.
2. Write a functions that removes the last index of the array.
3. Write a function that adds a new entry to the beginning of a array.
4. Write a function that removes the first entry of the array.
5. Write a function that makes a copy of a array.

### What you need

###### I want you to write a function and test this function using the red, green, refactor way

 1. RED: Write the test to have a expected and   actual value.

    ```
    git add -A

    git commit -m 'test wrote check mark will be red'

    git push origin 'your branch'

    ```

 1. GREEN: Write the function to make the test pass.

    ````
    export function example1(whatever1, whatever2){ 
    return 
    }
    ````

       ````
    export function example2(booger, booger2){ 
    return 
    }
    ````

    ```
    git add -A

    git commit -m 'test wrote and passing'

    git push origin 'your branch'

     ```

 2. REFACTOR: Refactor the code to as many lines as possible or if you can.

    ```
    git add -A

    git commit -m 'refactored and test passing'

    git push origin 'your branch'

     ```
