## Multiply Function TDD way

### What you need

###### I want you to write a function and test this function using the red, green, refactor way.

 1. RED: Write the test to have a expected and   actual value. 
    ```
    git add -A

    git commit -m 'test wrote check mark will be red'

    git push origin 'your branch'

    ```
 1. GREEN: Write the function to make the test pass.

    ````
    export function multiply(number1, number2){ 
    return 
    }
    ````

    ```
    git add -A

    git commit -m 'test wrote and passing'

    git push origin 'your branch'

     ```
 2. REFACTOR: Refactor the code to as many lines as possible or if you can.
    ```
    git add -A

    git commit -m 'refactored and test passing'

    git push origin 'your branch'

     ```
